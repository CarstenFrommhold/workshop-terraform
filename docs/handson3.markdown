## Goal

We want to create a new cloud storage bucket. After that we push a local file into this bucket and allow a other account to read this file.

## Steps

1. Copy the module to generate a new bucket with other name
2. Use thefirst bucket as terraform state backend
3. Upload all files in the module with terraform apply
4. Add permissions to this uploaded file
